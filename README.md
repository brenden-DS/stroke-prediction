A stroke prediction app using Streamlit is a user-friendly tool designed to assess an individual's risk of experiencing a stroke. By inputting relevant health data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors, the app utilizes predictive algorithms to calculate the user's likelihood of having a stroke. The app's intuitive interface and interactive features make it easy for users to understand their risk factors and take proactive measures to prevent stroke.

A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours, the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control.
